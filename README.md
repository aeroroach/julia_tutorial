Since Julia language is continuosly evolving, many function/package is deprecating easily. You might face error when you try to follow the tutorial in the internet and most of the tutorial is not utilizing Pluto which has some unique characteristics on code environment (that you can use Julia for the fullest).

This repository consist of example of code in Julia IDE format that you could follow throught easily with markdown explanation and I try to fix the deprecate function that could be found as much as possible. Please do notify me if there's deprecate function that need to modify.
